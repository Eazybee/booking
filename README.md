The objective of this code challange is to write unit tests to cover the BookingService.ts as much as possible.
Also, BookingService.ts should be refactor as needed in order to alow proper unit testing.

* Requirements: 
* Recent version of node.js (tested on 8.9.4). 
* Install Dependencies: `npm install`
* Run tests with file watching for fast feedback: `npm test -- --watch`
* Coverage `npm test -- --coverage`
